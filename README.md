# UCSC Pynome

 A Python UCSC Genome Browser Library
 
 ## Support
 
 Provides programmatic support for downloading sequence data from genomes, chromosomes, and specific coordinates as well as the liftover functionality on sets of sequences (usually contained within BED files). This API also provides object representation of concepts (such as genomes and sequences) for easier and less error-prone usage of the UCSC Genome Browser.
 
 ## Usage
 
 To set up this API for usage, run the ['setup script'](/ucscpynome/setup.sh) before running any code. TODO make setup scripts for each OS and link to those.
See [`example-workspace/new_api/`](/example-workspace/new_api) for examples of how to use this API.
